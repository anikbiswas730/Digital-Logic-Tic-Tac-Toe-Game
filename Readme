# Tic-Tac-Toe Digital Logic Implementation

A hardware implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using only digital logic ICs - no microcontrollers or programming required.

## Overview

This project implements a fully functional two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game using basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and D flip-flops. Players interact with the game through pushbuttons, and moves are displayed on a 3×3 LED grid with different colors representing each player.

## Features

- Pure hardware implementation using 74-series logic ICs
- 3×3 LED grid for visual feedback (Red for Player 1, Green for Player 2)
- Automatic turn switching between players
- Win detection for all 8 possible winning combinations
- Draw condition detection
- Reset button to start a new game
- Invalid move prevention (occupied cells, post-game inputs)

## Hardware Requirements

### ICs Used
- 7404 (NOT gate) - 15 units
- 7432 (OR gate) - 15 units
- 7411 (3-input AND gate) - 16 units
- 7408 (2-input AND gate) - 15 units
- 7474 (D flip-flop) - 28 units
- 7486 (XOR gate) - 18 units
- 4072 (4-input OR gate) - 25 units

### Other Components
- LEDs - 50 (Red, Green, Yellow)
- Pushbuttons (2-pin) - 10
- Resistors (1kΩ, 100Ω) - 200
- Breadboards - 15
- Jumper wires (M-M) - 12 packs
- 5V DC power supply

## Circuit Design

The project consists of four main logic units:

1. **Push Button Input Controller**: Stores button states and prevents re-input on occupied cells
2. **Player Selector**: Determines current player turn using XOR gate combinations
3. **Winner Selector**: Checks all 8 winning combinations for each player
4. **Draw Detector**: Identifies when all cells are filled without a winner

## How to Play

1. Connect the circuit to a 5V power supply
2. Player 1 (Red) starts by pressing any of the 9 grid buttons
3. Player 2 (Green) takes the next turn
4. Players alternate until someone wins or the board is full
5. Winner LED lights up (Red/Green) or Yellow LED for draw
6. Press RESET button to start a new game
